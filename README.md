# a-simple-bridge-network-example

The matlab files provided here provides an example on how to perform system reliability analysis to simple bridge network defined in Problem Description.pdf

The Probability of failure of the bridge network is calculated using a) Monte Carlo simulation b) Matrix-based system reliability analysis (MSR) and 3) Sequential compounding method (SCM).
