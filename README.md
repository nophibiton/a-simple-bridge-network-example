# a-simple-bridge-network-example

The matlab files here provides an example on how to perform system reliability analysis to a simple bridge network defined in Problem Description.pdf.

The Probability of failure of the bridge network is calculated using a) Monte Carlo simulation b) Matrix-based system reliability analysis (MSR) and 3) Sequential compounding method (SCM).
